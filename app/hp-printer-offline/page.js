          HP Printer Offline? Here's How to Fix HP Printer Keeps Going Offline
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-slate-600 italic">
          Your HP printer shows "offline" even though it's working. HP Smart keeps reporting it offline. It keeps happening. Here's why—and exactly how to fix it.
        </p>
      </header>

      <section className="space-y-10 p-4 mb-12">
        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">1. The "HP Smart Software" Conflict</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3">
            HP Smart software manages HP printer connections and status. When HP Smart is outdated, corrupted, or conflicts with Windows printer settings, it incorrectly reports printers as offline—even when they're working fine.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 bg-yellow-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 rounded-r">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Update HP Smart from Microsoft Store (open Store → search "HP Smart" → Update). If updating doesn't help, uninstall HP Smart completely, restart computer, then reinstall from Microsoft Store. Alternatively, remove HP Smart and use Windows built-in printer management—many HP printers work more reliably without HP Smart. Add printer directly through Windows Settings → Printers → Add printer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">2. The "WSD Port" Reliability Issue</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Windows automatically creates WSD (Web Services for Devices) ports for HP network printers. These ports are unreliable—they drop connections frequently, causing HP printers to show offline even when connected to Wi-Fi.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 bg-blue-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-blue-400 rounded-r">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Switch to Standard TCP/IP Port. Find your HP printer's IP address (print network configuration page or check printer display → Network → WiFi Information). Settings → Printers → HP printer → Printer properties → Ports tab → uncheck current WSD port → Add Port → Standard TCP/IP Port → enter printer's IP address → Finish. HP printers are much more stable with TCP/IP ports than WSD ports.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">3. The "HP Printer Sleep Mode" Problem</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3">
            HP printers enter sleep mode after inactivity to save power. When sleeping, Windows may detect them as unavailable and mark them offline. Some HP models have aggressive sleep settings that trigger quickly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 bg-green-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-green-400 rounded-r">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Disable or adjust HP printer sleep mode. Access printer settings through printer display panel → Settings → Power Settings → Sleep Mode → set to "Never" or increase timeout (e.g., 30 minutes instead of 5 minutes). Some HP printers have "Keep Printer Online" option—enable this. Alternatively, send periodic test prints to keep printer awake. HP Smart app may also have sleep mode settings—check there too.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">4. The "HP Universal Print Driver" Issue</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3">
            HP Universal Print Driver is a generic driver that works with many HP models. However, it can cause offline issues if it's outdated or conflicts with specific printer features. Some HP printers need model-specific drivers.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 bg-purple-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-purple-400 rounded-r">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Install model-specific HP driver instead of Universal driver. Go to HP website → Support → enter your exact printer model number → download driver for your Windows version. Uninstall Universal driver first (Device Manager → Printers → uninstall HP Universal driver). Install model-specific driver. Model-specific drivers are more reliable and less likely to cause offline issues. Check your printer model number on the front label or inside paper tray.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">5. The "HP Smart Ink Level" Reporting Error</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3">
            HP Smart checks ink levels frequently. If it can't communicate with cartridges (due to connection issues or cartridge chip problems), it may mark the printer as offline, even though printing works fine.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 bg-orange-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-orange-400 rounded-r">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Reset ink level reporting or disable HP Smart ink monitoring. Remove and reseat ink cartridges to reset chip communication. Update HP Smart software. If using third-party cartridges, HP Smart may report errors—consider using genuine HP cartridges or disabling ink level monitoring in HP Smart settings. Some HP printers allow disabling ink level checks in printer menu → Settings → Ink/Toner Settings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">6. The "HP ePrint" Service Interference</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Some HP printers use HP ePrint service for cloud printing. If ePrint service has issues or conflicts, it can cause the printer to show offline in HP Smart, even though local printing works.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2 bg-red-50 p-4 border-l-4 border-red-400 rounded-r">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Disable HP ePrint if you don't need cloud printing. Access printer settings → Network → ePrint → disable. Or disable in HP Smart app → Printer Settings → ePrint → turn off. This eliminates ePrint-related connection issues. If you need ePrint, ensure printer firmware is updated (HP Smart → Printer Settings → Updates → check for firmware updates). Restart printer after disabling ePrint.
